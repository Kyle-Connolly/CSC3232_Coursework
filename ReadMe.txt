Instructions:
To play the game press the play button in the editor. This will spawn you into Level 1.

Game Rules:
Defeat all enemies to access the water area and teleporter to end the game. If you die at any time, you may press enter to restart the level. If you make it to the end, you will be greeted with a menu where you can decide if you would like to play again. Landing hits and combos earns you score points.

Enemies:
Enemies will first start out on patrol in a small area. If they have line of sight on you, they will begin to chase you until they lose line of sight, at which point they will search the area, randomly. There is a chance that they may go back to patrol their original route.
The Cryo enemy (blue), does damage upon bumping into you. Staying in its attack range will do damage to you over time.
The Shrouded enemy (purple), fires tempest projectiles at you. This is the same attack the player has at their disposal. This enemy will remain at a safe distance from the player. It also has the chance to burst fire two projectiles.

Attacks (Elemental Charges):
Tempest - fires a projectile (affected by gravity) does the most damage but costs the most. It also briefly stun locks the enemy on a successful hit.
Inferno - does medium damage and knocks back the enemy and uses medium resources.
Hydro - damage does the least damage but uses the least resources. 
Combo – doing a hydro attack followed by an inferno attack (within 5 seconds) will deal double damage.

Movement:
Vector Launch - a super jump with cooldown that can also function as a double jump.
Vector Drive – boost/thruster mechanic with cooldown boosting the player in the direction they are travelling in temporarily. This allows for quick adjustments on the ground and in the air. Cooldown: 

Environment:
Make use of the towers to out maneuverer the enemies.
Entering the skull platform will turn the ground into a fiery plane, increasing visibility. This is a one-time use, so use it when you want to exercise a combat strategy
The platform and its trophy, the spear, are sacred. Firing through its area it will cause projectiles to be caught mid-air and quickly destroyed at the base of the platform.
